# TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework

---

## 🔱 TradingAgents-Axon — how this fork diverges from upstream

**This is [`samyrwendel/TradingAgents-Axon`](https://github.com/samyrwendel/TradingAgents-Axon)**, a
fork of [`TauricResearch/TradingAgents`](https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents). It tracks
upstream via the `origin` remote (we pull their improvements) and ships our own changes on the `axon`
remote — **we never push to `origin`**. The divergences below make the framework trustworthy for
**backtesting** and turn it into a product-grade base for the *Degenerados* community. Everything is
additive and fail-open: with our features disabled the framework behaves exactly like upstream.

### 1. Data-governance cache — *historical data is immutable* (in-repo)
`tradingagents/datacache/` implements a universal disk cache: **a request whose window ends before
today is fetched once and kept forever; only the current day expires; a known failure (429/empty) is
negatively cached for a few hours** so a dead source isn't hammered. It hooks the vendor funnel
(`interface.VENDOR_METHODS`), the two social fetchers (Reddit/StockTwits, keyed by ticker+day so a
12-date backtest fetches once instead of 12×, killing the Reddit 429 storm), and the price loader
(stable `{symbol}-YFin-5y.csv` instead of a new 5-year CSV per day). It is activated from
`tradingagents/__init__.py` and rewrites the upstream modules **in memory** at import, so an `origin`
pull that changes their source never breaks it. Disable with `TA_DATACACHE_DISABLE=1`; relocate the
store with `TA_DATACACHE_DIR`. *(Was an out-of-tree `.pth` patch; promoted to first-class fork code.)*

### 2. Anti look-ahead date guard — every backtest is honest
`tradingagents/agents/utils/date_guard.py` pins the run's analysis date as a **base date** (set around
the graph run) and clamps every date-taking tool argument (`get_news`, `get_global_news`,
`get_macro_indicators`, `get_stock_data`, `get_indicators`) down to it. An analyst asking for data
"up to today" during a 2021 backtest is transparently corrected to 2021 — **a past-dated run can never
pull data dated after it**. Live runs (analysis date = today) are unaffected. *(Concept ported, not
copied, from `TheLocalLab/TradingAgents-GUI@40e97f34`, whose `normalize_date` accepts a base but leaves
enforcement to the caller; we make clamping automatic and non-optional.)*

### 3. FRED macro works out of the box
The `.env` (with `FRED_API_KEY`) is now loaded at import even when the optional `python-dotenv` package
is absent (a stdlib fallback loader was added). Previously the silent `ImportError` meant macro data
fell back to *"unavailable"* unless you exported `FRED_API_KEY` by hand. `macro_data` defaults to `fred`,
so the news analyst grounds commentary in real numbers (CPI, Fed funds, yields) with no setup.

### 4. Prediction markets are mandatory in the news report
The news analyst is nudged to call `get_prediction_markets` (Polymarket, keyless), and if it still
skips it the node **deterministically appends a Prediction Markets section** — implied probabilities for
standing forward-looking themes (rates, recession) plus the instrument, or an explicit *"no market for
this topic"* line. The report is never silent on market-implied probabilities.
(`tradingagents/agents/utils/prediction_market_coverage.py`.)

### 5. Multi-timeframe market analysis — weekly *and* daily
Upstream's market analyst only ever saw the **daily** frame. The BE backtest exposed the cost: its one
wrong `Overweight` (14 Aug) bought the first candle of a top the weekly had already started rolling
over. The analyst now calls `get_price_timeframes`, which resamples the same cached, `<= curr_date`-cut
daily series into a **weekly** frame in memory (no extra network, no new look-ahead surface) and returns
both trend reads plus an explicit **converge / diverge** verdict — weekly for the dominant trend, daily
for timing. If the report omits a frame, the node **deterministically appends the weekly+daily section**.
(`tradingagents/dataflows/multi_timeframe.py`, `tradingagents/agents/utils/multi_timeframe_coverage.py`.)

### 6. Real crypto derivatives — funding, open interest, liquidations
Upstream "crypto support" (and the 131-star `0x0funky/TradingAgents-crypto`) is just handing a `BTC-USD`
ticker to yfinance — blind to what actually moves a perp. On a crypto asset the market analyst now calls
`get_crypto_derivatives`, which pulls the derivatives layer from **keyless public feeds** (the same
approach the house's degenbot uses on Hyperliquid), degrades **per source** if one is down, and never
fabricates a value:

| signal | primary source | fallback |
|---|---|---|
| funding rate | Hyperliquid `metaAndAssetCtxs` (1h) | Binance `fundingRate` (8h, historical) |
| open interest | Hyperliquid `metaAndAssetCtxs` | Binance `openInterest(Hist)` |
| liquidations | OKX `public/liquidation-orders` | — (live/recent window only) |
| mark / 24h vol | Hyperliquid `metaAndAssetCtxs` | Binance `premiumIndex` |

Crypto is **24/7**: every window is driven by UTC millisecond timestamps, weekends are normal trading
days, and the read applies to any weekday. It flows through the **same cache** (`crypto_derivatives`
category — second same-day run is served from disk, zero network) and the **same date guard** (a
backtest date reads Binance funding *history* clamped to that day and degrades OI/liquidations that only
retain a recent window, rather than borrowing today's number). If the report omits the signal the node
appends it deterministically. (`tradingagents/dataflows/crypto.py`,
`tradingagents/agents/utils/crypto_coverage.py`.)

> Not in this fork yet (separate tasks): community interface, exchange-native crypto OHLCV as the price
> path (derivatives are covered above; spot/perp candles still come from yfinance for crypto).

## TradingAgents Framework

TradingAgents is a multi-agent trading framework that mirrors the dynamics of real-world trading firms. By deploying specialized LLM-powered agents: from fundamental analysts, sentiment experts, and technical analysts, to trader, risk management team, the platform collaboratively evaluates market conditions and informs trading decisions. Moreover, these agents engage in dynamic discussions to pinpoint the optimal strategy.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/schema.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>

> TradingAgents framework is designed for research purposes. Trading performance may vary based on many factors, including the chosen backbone language models, model temperature, trading periods, the quality of data, and other non-deterministic factors. [It is not intended as financial, investment, or trading advice.](https://tauric.ai/disclaimer/)

Our framework decomposes complex trading tasks into specialized roles.

### Analyst Team
- Fundamentals Analyst: Evaluates company financials and performance metrics, identifying intrinsic values and potential red flags.
- Sentiment Analyst: Aggregates news headlines, StockTwits, and Reddit chatter into a single sentiment read to gauge short-term market mood.
- News Analyst: Monitors global news and macroeconomic indicators, interpreting the impact of events on market conditions.
- Technical Analyst: Utilizes technical indicators (like MACD and RSI) to detect trading patterns and forecast price movements.

</p>

### Researcher Team
- Comprises both bullish and bearish researchers who critically assess the insights provided by the Analyst Team. Through structured debates, they balance potential gains against inherent risks.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/researcher.png" width="70%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

### Trader Agent
- Composes reports from the analysts and researchers to make informed trading decisions, determining the timing and magnitude of trades.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/trader.png" width="70%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

### Risk Management and Portfolio Manager
- Continuously evaluates portfolio risk by assessing market volatility, liquidity, and other risk factors. The risk management team evaluates and adjusts trading strategies, providing assessment reports to the Portfolio Manager for final decision.
- The Portfolio Manager approves/rejects the transaction proposal. If approved, the order will be sent to the simulated exchange and executed.

## Installation and CLI

### Installation

Clone TradingAgents:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents.git
cd TradingAgents
```

Create a virtual environment in any of your favorite environment managers:
```bash
conda create -n tradingagents python=3.12
conda activate tradingagents
```

Install the package and its dependencies:
```bash
pip install .
```

### Docker

Alternatively, run with Docker:
```bash
cp .env.example .env  # add your API keys
docker compose run --rm tradingagents
```

For local models with Ollama:
```bash
docker compose --profile ollama run --rm tradingagents-ollama
```

### Required APIs

TradingAgents supports multiple LLM providers. Set the API key for your chosen provider:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...          # OpenAI (GPT)
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=...          # Google (Gemini)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...       # Anthropic (Claude)
export XAI_API_KEY=...             # xAI (Grok)
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...        # DeepSeek
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=...       # Qwen — International (dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com)
export DASHSCOPE_CN_API_KEY=...    # Qwen — China (dashscope.aliyuncs.com)
export ZHIPU_API_KEY=...           # GLM via Z.AI (international)
export ZHIPU_CN_API_KEY=...        # GLM via BigModel (China, open.bigmodel.cn)
export MINIMAX_API_KEY=...         # MiniMax — Global (api.minimax.io)
export MINIMAX_CN_API_KEY=...      # MiniMax — China (api.minimaxi.com)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...      # OpenRouter
export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=...   # Alpha Vantage
```

For Azure OpenAI, copy `.env.enterprise.example` to `.env.enterprise` and fill in your credentials.

For AWS Bedrock, install the extra with `pip install ".[bedrock]"`, set `llm_provider: "bedrock"`, configure AWS credentials (environment variables, `~/.aws/credentials`, or an IAM role) and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, and use a Bedrock model ID, e.g. `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8-v1:0`.

For local models, configure Ollama with `llm_provider: "ollama"`. The default endpoint is `http://localhost:11434/v1`; set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to point at a remote `ollama-serve`. Pull models with `ollama pull <name>`, and pick "Custom model ID" in the CLI for any model not listed by default.

For any other OpenAI-compatible server (vLLM, LM Studio, llama.cpp, or a custom relay), use `llm_provider: "openai_compatible"` and set the endpoint via `backend_url` (or `TRADINGAGENTS_LLM_BACKEND_URL`), e.g. `http://localhost:8000/v1` for vLLM or `http://localhost:1234/v1` for LM Studio. The model is whatever your server serves. No key is needed for local servers; set `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` when the endpoint requires one.

Alternatively, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your keys:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### CLI Usage

Launch the interactive CLI:
```bash
tradingagents          # installed command
python -m cli.main     # alternative: run directly from source
```
You will see a screen where you can select your desired tickers, analysis date, LLM provider, research depth, and more.

### Markets and tickers

TradingAgents works with any market Yahoo Finance covers, using the exchange-suffixed ticker. Company identity and the alpha benchmark resolve automatically per market.

- US: `AAPL`, `SPY`
- Hong Kong: `0700.HK` · Tokyo: `7203.T` · London: `AZN.L`
- India: `RELIANCE.NS`, `.BO` · Canada: `.TO` · Australia: `.AX`
- China A-shares: Shanghai `.SS`, Shenzhen `.SZ` (e.g. `600519.SS` for Kweichow Moutai)
- Crypto: `BTC-USD`, `ETH-USD`

## TradingAgents Package

### Implementation Details

We built TradingAgents with LangGraph to ensure flexibility and modularity. The framework supports multiple LLM providers: OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI, DeepSeek, Qwen (Alibaba DashScope, international and China endpoints), GLM (Zhipu), MiniMax (global + China), OpenRouter, Ollama for local models, and Azure OpenAI for enterprise.

### Python Usage

To use TradingAgents inside your code, you can import the `tradingagents` module and initialize a `TradingAgentsGraph()` object. The `.propagate()` function will return a decision. You can run `main.py`, here's also a quick example:

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy())

# forward propagate
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-01-15")
print(decision)
```

You can also adjust the default configuration to set your own choice of LLMs, debate rounds, etc.

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["llm_provider"] = "openai"        # e.g. openai, google, anthropic, deepseek, groq, ollama; openai_compatible covers any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (vLLM, LM Studio, llama.cpp, ...)
config["deep_think_llm"] = "gpt-5.5"     # Model for complex reasoning
config["quick_think_llm"] = "gpt-5.4-mini" # Model for quick tasks
config["max_debate_rounds"] = 2

ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=config)
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-01-15")
print(decision)
```

See `tradingagents/default_config.py` for all configuration options.

## Persistence and Recovery

TradingAgents persists two kinds of state across runs.

### Decision log

The decision log is always on. Each completed run appends its decision to `~/.tradingagents/memory/trading_memory.md`. On the next run for the same ticker, TradingAgents fetches the realised return (raw and alpha vs SPY), generates a one-paragraph reflection, and injects the most recent same-ticker decisions plus recent cross-ticker lessons into the Portfolio Manager prompt, so each analysis carries forward what worked and what didn't.

Override the path with `TRADINGAGENTS_MEMORY_LOG_PATH`.

### Checkpoint resume

Checkpoint resume is opt-in via `--checkpoint`. When enabled, LangGraph saves state after each node so a crashed or interrupted run resumes from the last successful step instead of starting over. On a resume run you will see `Resuming from step N for <TICKER> on <date>` in the logs; on a new run you will see `Starting fresh`. Checkpoints are cleared automatically on successful completion.

Per-ticker SQLite databases live at `~/.tradingagents/cache/checkpoints/<TICKER>.db` (override the base with `TRADINGAGENTS_CACHE_DIR`). Use `--clear-checkpoints` to reset all of them before a run.

```bash
tradingagents analyze --checkpoint           # enable for this run
tradingagents analyze --clear-checkpoints    # reset before running
```

```python
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["checkpoint_enabled"] = True
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(config=config)
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-01-15")
```

## Reproducibility

TradingAgents is LLM-driven, so two runs of the same ticker and date can differ. This is expected for a research tool built on language models, not a defect. The variation comes from a few distinct sources, and it helps to separate them.

Language model sampling is non-deterministic. Even at a fixed temperature, providers do not guarantee byte-identical output across calls, and reasoning models (the default GPT-5.x family, and any thinking-mode model) vary the most because their internal reasoning is itself sampled.

Live data moves. News, StockTwits, and Reddit return different content as time passes, so a run today sees different inputs than a run last week even for the same historical trade date. Pin the analysis date to hold the price and indicator window fixed, but the social and news sources still reflect "now".

To reduce variation you can lower the sampling temperature. Set `temperature` in your config (or `TRADINGAGENTS_TEMPERATURE` in `.env`); lower values make models that honor it more repeatable. The current curated models are reasoning-first and largely ignore temperature, so for tighter reproducibility use a non-reasoning model, which you can set explicitly via the Custom model ID option.

```python
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["llm_provider"] = "openai"
config["temperature"] = 0.0
# Reasoning models ignore temperature. For tighter reproducibility, set a
# non-reasoning deep/quick model explicitly (e.g. via the Custom model ID option).
```

What does not vary anymore: the analyzed company identity is resolved deterministically from the ticker before any agent runs, and the market analyst grounds exact price and indicator claims in a verified data snapshot. Earlier reports of "different companies" or fabricated price levels across runs are addressed by these two mechanisms.

Backtest results are not guaranteed to match any published figure. Returns depend on the model, the temperature, the date range, data quality, and the sampling above. Treat the framework as a research scaffold for studying multi-agent analysis, not as a strategy with a fixed, replicable return.
